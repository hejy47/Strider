This repository consits of all relevant artifacts of Strider.

## 1. Strider Framework

The framework of Strider is present as follows:

![](doc/figs/overview.jpg)

We aim to contribute an APR technique toward Verilog programs that leverages signal value transition. We release the complete source code Strider that covers the whole automated defect repair pipeline, including defect localization, patch synthesis and patch validation. We hope the publicly available implementation could facilitate follow-up research towards hardware deisign code.

## 2. Reproduction

### 2.1. Downloading the Repository

Use the following command to download the artifact repository:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hejy47/Strider.git
```

### 2.2. Configuration

To run Strider, you will need to compile `Pyverilog` if you have not done so already:
```
make
```

And instanll the following python packages
```
pip install dataclasses PyVCD
```

Configure the [`cirfix_benchmarks`](https://github.com/hammad-a/verilog_repair/tree/master/benchmarks) and [`Assignment4V`](https://github.com/hejy47/Assignment4V.git) dataset:
```
cd benchmarks;
unzip cirfix_benchmarks;
git clone https://github.com/hejy47/Assignment4V.git dataset_Assignment4V
cp dataset_Assignment4V/dataset/* ./
```

We use the following tools for compilation and simulation of Verilog code:

* Icarus Verilog: `sudo apt-get install iverilog` (for Ubuntu)
* Synopsys VCS (Commercial license)

### 2.3. Execution

Our prototype of Strider needs three input options for execution:

* `--benchmark/-b`: the benchmark name. (`cirfix_benchmarks` for the example)
* `--project/-p`: the project name of defective program of the benchmakr. (`fsm_full` for the example)
* `--version/-v`: the identifier of the defective program. (`1` for the example)

```
Example: python strider/Main.py -b cirfix_benchmarks -p fsm_full -v 1
```
